# ImageToASCII
## How to use
`python imageTOASCII.py /path/to/image num_pixels`  
1. First argument is the path to image file, if you using windows you must use double backslah eg. "C:\users\username\pictures\image.jpg")
2. Second argument is represent how much the pixels will be converted to one ASCII character. The input must be integer number, i recommend to set the value around 20. Also smaller number will make the ASCII art bigger and more detailed.
